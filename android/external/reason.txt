CMake downloads and builds external dependencies from Github repository ( using FetchContent )
Gradle wants to delete most files during build, which fails on git files.
The only way to succeed in this scenario is to store downloaded dependencies outside externalNativeBuild directory.
This trick has probably one drawback - you cannot build for more than one ABI ( at least as long as CMake
has no option to store downloaded *-src directories in different place than *-build and *-subbuild directories ).
